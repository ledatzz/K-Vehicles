Hereâ€™s a simple example to load the dataset using PyTorch:

```python
import torch
from torchvision import datasets, transforms

transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToTensor(),
])

dataset = datasets.ImageFolder(root='path/to/dataset', transform=transform)
data_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)
```

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ledatzz/K-Vehicles.git
cd K-Vehicles
```
